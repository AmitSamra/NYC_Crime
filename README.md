[NYC OpenData](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u) offers data published by New York City agencies, including the New York City Police Department. This project performs exploratory analysis on NYPD historical valid arrests (those that were not voided due to lack of cause) spanning 14 years from 2006 to 2019, inclusive. I use R, ggplot2 and mongoDB to clean, analyze and persist data.
